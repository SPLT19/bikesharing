# Bike sharing Analysis

## Overview
The following Analysis consisted on digging into a City Bike program, describe it, and bring forth a interactive visualization of the data to share and determine plausibility of replica for business purposes.

In order to portrait a clear visualization Tableau Public was used. Dataset was modified with help of Pandas with Python language in Jupyter Notebook, to transform variables into the better datatype to interpret and work with the variables of date time. 

The following [Link](https://public.tableau.com/views/CityCykeProyect/BikeStory?:language=es-ES&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) redirects to Tableau Story.

### Tools: 
Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Directory, Python, Tableau Public 2022.2.0 version

# Results

For the analysis of the data, as said transformation of variables where performed to secure readability for analysis purposes. As such the analysis consisted of:

- Data modification
- Visualization
- Story Integration with Tableau Public


## Data Transformation
Variable type was evaluated and modified using pandas library. 
Code can be found [here]()

Modifications: 

- Initial data type

- Transforming code

- Results


## Visualization in Tableau
The following where the different Charts and Graphs developed using Tableau Public


## Story Integration with Tableau Public
After creating the different charts and graphs, the following Dashboards were created surrounding different aspects of the data analysis. It included analysis of the main aspects of each group of data.

## Story Integration with Tableau Public
Finally using all the charts and Dashboards a story was created, uploaded, and published. 


## Data Analysis main point results: 
City Bike project had a total number od 2, 344,22 trips during the follow up period of the dataset. 
Out of those totals of trips a total of 13,983 members where involved, with different average in use between members, Involving different ages for users. Main spikes in trip duration average was found in users born in 1890 and another one with users born in 1970, but in average the Trip Duration Average for users was around 500 during the follow up period. 

Bike Share program general Information:
The following shows the total Number of Trips, user types, Trip duration by age, and trip duration by minutes per hour durations.
As seen must users of the bikes are Subscribers and the average trip duration is around 1 hour with most of them short trips of less than 40 min 2 big Peek Hours for the service was found between 8 and 9am and 5 to 7pm. Whereas, Lowest activity was reported between 1 am and 4 am. Meaning this seem to be good hours for repair or clean up service. 
Busiest day pf the week were weekdays

Locations and Service time
Following Maps show most frequent start point and end point of trips. Notice that both almost overlap, meaning the areas might be related to important or busy city locations. 
Bike Utilization per user seem to have some average, although there are some users that frequent the service in a constant manner.  Bike repairs per user range from around 500 to 1 

Regarding Gender
Gender related information revealed that subscribers tended to be more Males users. The busiest day was Thursday in this gender. Female subscribers didnâ€™t seem to have a frequent day for the use of the service, but hot zones for usage remained around same tie and weekday in both genders. 
Unknown gender users were not as common but seemed to appear more during weekends. This seems the same for non-subscribers customers using the service. 
Trip duration was higher for males than females, but neither used more than 2 hours the bikes. 


## Summary
As shown with the analysis and visualisation, its seen that the major of users that choose this type of program are male, whereas women use the service with less frequency and are often casual customers not subscribers. If this population was aimed for this program, further research would be needed to plan a strategy that could make the program appealable for women as strongly as for men.  

Location seem to be related to specific busy or milestone areas as both start and end for trips are around the same zones. Further research would be needed to find out other plausible variables that made those zones as active compared to others. 
Regarding Time schedules, the service demand was more active around 7 am to 9 am and another peak around 5 pm to 7 pm, perhaps related to work schedules and work commute time schedules. However data to corroborate this would be needed to establish the objective relationship. 
Busiest day for the program were Thursday afternoons. 

Regarding trip duration, they were always less than 1 hour and a half on average duration of 20 to 30 min. 

### Additional proposed analysis. 

Despite understanding how the program works in New York, perhaps deeper research would find useful for example using polls to further analyse reasons to choosing the service, and other input that the customers and users could provide in order to understand the benefits and perhaps weakness of the program in order to adapt it for the business proposal area and population. 
Further city characteristics and understanding of the program would be proposed to conclude if this project could be replicated in other locations. However, the following analysis helps understand the general information about the population and basic characteristics.
